### About
You are looking at a copy of a Google.com search results page made using HTML5 and CSS3. I made this as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum to practise and show what I've learned. 

Please visit my codepen [project](https://codepen.io/KellyHuliselan/full/JZqrrz/) to see how this code renders in the browser. 

It was made using Atom, Google Chrome and Cloudinary. Please keep in mind that I focussed on esthetics and not so much on responsiveness.
